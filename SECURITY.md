# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

If this project is hosted on GitHub, use Security Advisories to report issues:
`https://github.com/tiagosousa4/twitter-ai-detector/security/advisories`

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a private support request
through the repository owner.

## Response Expectations
- Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
- Provide a status update within 7 days.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest released version is supported with security updates.

## Scope
Report issues such as:
- Exposure of API keys or user data
- Message spoofing between extension components
- Injection or privilege escalation paths in the extension
- Unexpected data exfiltration

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research and will not pursue action for
accidental, non-destructive testing that respects user privacy.
